## Introduction

In this assignment, you will be taking a basic HTML-coded webpage, with its two linked images, and resizing and relinking the images to webpages so that the images are of an appropriate size.

> ### Note
>
> Be sure you have reviewed the content page on “Image Manipulation” in Canvas, which contains links to important materials (e.g., textbook readings, links to outside readings, etc.).

## Instructions

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment by clicking the link found in Canvas
   - **Only Click the link once.** Clicking the link after accepting the assignment will produce an error.
   - your instructor will enable GitHub pages within 24 hours of accepting the assignment.
2. Clone the project to your local computer.

3. Once cloned to your local computer, open the project in your editor (like VSC) and click on `index.html` to see the website in a browser. Notice how both the first and the second image are too large.

4. Your job is to fix this website by resizing, renaming, and recoding (in the HTML code) the images and then pushing the website to your GitHub Classroom repo and submitting the URL to the dropbox.

### A couple of guidelines:

- Keep the old images in the `images` folder, but remove them from appearing on the webpage (edit the link information).
- Add your new, resized images to the `images` folder, too.
- Rewrite the `html` file to reflect the new image names.
- The new image files placed onto the webpage (in place of the old ones) should be under 100kb in size, and they should have a similar aspect ratio to their original (that is, they should not be distorted).
- When you resize each image, add the word “small” to the filename. For example:
  - `hortence.jpg` → `hortence_small.jpg`
  - `mauricio.jpg`→ `mauricio_small.jpg`

## Project Submission

- Push the project back to your repo. Post the URL to your GitHub Pages.

- GitHub pages will be enabled on the `Web` branch.
- you may develop on he `main` brach and then checkout or push the `Web` bracnh.
- it is important that you note the difference between the repo url and the Pages url. **You will be graded based off of the Pages URL**
- Pages URL will start begin with `twucsci.github.io` while the repo will begin with `twucsci.ghthub.com`.
- you can view the live version of this site on GitHub Pages at: `https://twucsci.github.io/image-manipulation-template/mauricio_page/`

> ### Hint
>
> Make sure your links are still valid after upload! If the image links do not work after upload, you will need to revise the links so that links are valid on the server.
>
> ### Hint 2
>
> Any link that starts with `C:\` or `file://` will never be a valid and functional link on the server.

**Post the URL for your deployed GitHub Pages URL to the Assignment: Image Manipulation dropbox in Canvas.**
